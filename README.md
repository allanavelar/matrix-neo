# Neo v4: iris
<a href="https://liberapay.com/f0x/donate"><img alt="Donate using Liberapay" src="https://liberapay.com/assets/widgets/donate.svg"></a>  

Currently this is only gui work, no functional API connections yet.  
The latest build is hosted at [neo.lain.haus/neo](https://neo.lain.haus/neo)

## Building
Keep in mind it's not useable rn;  
`npm install`  
`gulp build`  
static assets should now be in `build/`

## Vision
Currently this is just gui work. This will be as protocol-agnostic as possible,
but the reference backend implementation will be for [Matrix](https://matrix.org)

## Why the name
Neo and the rabbit logo are both from Matrix. Iris is the personification of the rainbow and messenger of the gods in Greek mythology, so I found that fitting as well.

## Code of Conduct
We follow the Rust one, see CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
