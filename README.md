# Neo v4: iris
<a href="https://liberapay.com/f0x/donate"><img alt="Donate using Liberapay" src="https://liberapay.com/assets/widgets/donate.svg"></a>  

A lightweight [Matrix](https://matrix.org) webclient, with basic functionality.  
The latest build is hosted at [neo.pixie.town/app](https://neo.pixie.town/app)

## Building
Keep in mind it's not quite useable currently;  
`npm install`  
`gulp build`  
static assets should now be in `build/`

## Vision
There's demand for nicer Matrix clients in general, and I've been trying to fill this gap for a while now. I chose a web-based approach, since those are the technologies I like, and enjoy using. This is very much a 'fun' sid project at the moment.  
Neo doesn't use Electron, but might be packaged with some Rust based webview for a more 'desktop' experience. If you're religiously opposed to JavaScript I'll refer you to [nuclear's readme](https://github.com/nukeop/nuclear#what-if-i-am-religiously-opposed-to-using-electron-for-any-and-all-purposes)

## Why the name
Neo and the rabbit logo are both from Matrix. Iris is the personification of the rainbow and messenger of the gods in Greek mythology, so I found that fitting as well.
